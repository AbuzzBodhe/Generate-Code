# GPT-2 Fine-Tuning for Python Code Exercises

This repository contains code for fine-tuning a GPT-2 model to solve Python code exercises. It uses a dataset of coding problems and solutions and includes two main scripts: `fine_tune_gpt2.py` for model training and `test_gpt2.py` for testing the fine-tuned model.

## Repository Contents

- `fine_tune_gpt2.py`: Script to fine-tune a GPT-2 model on Python code exercises using the dataset `jinaai/code_exercises`. The model is trained to generate solutions for coding problems.
- `test_gpt2.py`: Script to test the fine-tuned GPT-2 model on new coding problems and evaluate its performance.

## Requirements

Install the required packages listed in `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
